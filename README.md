## Installation & updates

`composer create-project dasua/codeigniter-4-appstarter-for-developers` then `composer update` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.

When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply
to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from
`vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.

## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
